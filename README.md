Project : [Mood](https://github.com/pskanade/mood)

This is one of the projects that I wanted to do for a very long time. It is just a real time polling application, I've build by watching three youtube videos -

1. [Initial Backend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSDED3XKz-0&t=509s)
2. [Front end js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrIiWAnxXYs&t=24s)
3. [Mongo DB & mongoose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ6wMonyVyY)
