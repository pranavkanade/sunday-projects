This is one of the projects that I wanted to do for a very long time. It is just a real time polling application, I've build by watching three youtube videos -

Project: [allnighter.in](https://allnighter.in)
Source Code: [pskanade.github.io](https://github.com/pskanade/pskanade.github.io)

Its not true, I've been working on this since past three days. I got it up and running. Site is pretty dope. There is a grid layout that I borrowed from some guy over github. This theme is freely available. It is called Forty.. ! It is static website based on jekyll. I guess I should write a writeup about how I made the chagnes to it. It looks kinda similar now but, a lot of effort went into editing it. I did pull an **allnighter** for it.
